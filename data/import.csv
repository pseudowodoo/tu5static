Harmonix is a web-based singing training application that helps users develop their pitch accuracy and harmony skills through interactive exercises. The app uses your device's microphone to listen to your singing in real-time and provides instant feedback on your performance.

How it works:
1.        Onboarding: When you first use the app, you select your voice type (male or female) so the exercises are calibrated to a comfortable pitch range for you. The app then tests your microphone to ensure it can hear you properly.

2.        Progressive Learning Path: The app has three levels that gradually increase in difficulty:
•        Level 0: Pitch matching basics - You sing simple sustained notes to develop pitch accuracy
•        Level 1: Melody singing - You learn to sing familiar melodies note-by-note
•        Level 2: Harmony training - You sing harmony notes (like major and minor thirds) while the app plays a reference melody

3.        Real-time Feedback: As you sing, the app analyzes your voice using pitch detection technology and shows:
•        Visual feedback on whether you're hitting the right notes
•        Your pitch compared to the target pitch (with visual bars and graphs)
•        Helpful hints and encouragement from an animated mascot character
•        Progress tracking showing your accuracy scores

4.        Adaptive Difficulty: You need to achieve certain scores to unlock higher levels. The app tracks your best performances and lets you retry exercises to improve.
